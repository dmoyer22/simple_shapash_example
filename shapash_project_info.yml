Model training:
  Used algorithm: We used a RandomForestRegressor algorithm (scikit-learn) but this model could be challenged with other interesting models such as XGBRegressor, Neural Networks, ...
  Parameters choice: We did not perform any hyperparameter optimisation and chose to use `n_estimators=50`. Future works should be planned to perform gridsearch optimizations
  Metrics: Mean Squared Error metric
  Validation strategy: We splitted our data into train (60%) and test (40%)
